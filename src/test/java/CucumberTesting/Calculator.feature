Feature:Calculator

  As a user
  I want to perform basic arithmetic operations
  So that I can calculate mathematical expressions

  Scenario: Add two numbers
    Given I have entered 6 into the calculator
    And I have entered 7 into the calculator
    When I Press add
    Then the result should be 13 on the screen.

  Scenario: Subtract two numbers
    Given I have entered 10 into the calculator
    And I have entered 5 into the calculator
    When I Press subtract
    Then the result should be 5 on the screen
